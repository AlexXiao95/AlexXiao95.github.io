Experiences
======

### [Information Processing Lab](http://allison.ee.washington.edu/index_files/Page701.htm) (IPL), UW

Graduate Research Assistant, supervised by [*Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang*](http://www.ee.washington.edu/people/jenq-neng-hwang/)

* Realized a fully unsupervised online learning framework to achieve **multi-camera tracking** of people
* Designed multi-camera tracking of vehicle with a fusion of adaptive appearance, semantic features and comparison of license plates
* Participated in [*NVIDIA AI City challenge 2018*](https://www.aicitychallenge.org), which held as a workshop at [*CVPR 2018*](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com), and achieved a superiority performance in both Track 1: Traffic Flow Analysis and Track 3: Multi-camera Vehicle Detection & Reidentification, among over 20 teams

### **[Image, Video, and Multimedia Communication Lab](http://ivm.sjtu.edu.cn) (IVM), SJTU**

Undergraduate Research Assistant, supervised by [*Prof. Weiyao Lin*](https://weiyaolin.github.io).

* Collected two challenging group re-identification datasets by tracking people in a crowd scene and implementing socially constraint structure learning to detect groups.
* Developed a multi-grain **group re-identification** process which derives features for multi-grain objects and iteratively evaluates their importance to handle interferences from group dynamics.
* Proposed a multi-order matching process by a personalized random walk scheme through a multi-order association graph, which integrated multi-grain information to obtain more reliable group matching results.

Project Leader of an Intelligent System

* Achieved a real-time object detection system by training detection model based on YOLO, which can classify abnormal events.
* Utilized graph matching algorithm based on confident tracklets to develop multiple object tracking algorithm.
* Implemented a **real-time UAV-based intelligent tracking system** on video stream by combining detection and tracking algorithm


### **[Research Center of Intelligent Internet of Things](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/) (IIOT), SJTU**

Project Team Leader, supervised by [*Prof. Xinbing Wang*](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).

* Conducted the construction and maintenance of an academic search system: [*Acemap*](https://acemap.info).
* Analyzed a large scale academic dataset, [*Microsoft Academic Graph*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/) (MAG), which included data crawling, cleaning and processing.
* Adapted topic model to recognize the relationship between word topics and document topics.
* Designed a novel “interactive map” approach to visualize large-scale academic literatures and display the deep relationship among them.
