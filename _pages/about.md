I am a senior research engineer specializing in computer vision and machine learning, with over five years of experience in autonomous driving technology. Currently, I work at [NVIDIA]https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), where I focus on developing state-of-the-art 3D bird’s-eye view detection and object tracking algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Previously, I was a Senior Research Engineer at [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com/), where I built the company's first motion prediction system and led projects that achieved the [world’s first “driver out” pilot program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgFqS4mi0Qw&list=PLZMaa5B165Ps_PoShcA-o6PTU6W16A6hb).

I hold a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I worked under [Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/), and a Bachelor’s degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was guided by [Prof. Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io/). My research has been published in leading conferences and journals, including CVPR, ICRA and ACM MM, and I have several pending patents in autonomous vehicle technology.

My expertise includes computer vision, deep learning, perception, prediction, and planning systems. I have a strong track record of developing innovative solutions and leading projects that push the boundaries of autonomous driving. My goal is to continue advancing the field of autonomous technology, making transportation safer and more efficient for everyone.
