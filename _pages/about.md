I am a machine learning engineer at [TuSimple](http://www.tusimple.com/index-en.html), and our goal is to bring the first self-driving truck to market. Before that, I was a master student of [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://www.ee.washington.edu/) at [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu).

I am a quick learner, problem solver and team worker who has a strong passion in machine learning and computer vision, as well as system development.
