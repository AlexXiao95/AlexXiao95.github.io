"BE BOUNDLESS"

I am currently first-year master student of [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.washington.edu/) at [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu). My principal interests lie in the area of computer vision. Now I am a Member of [Information Processing Lab](http://allison.ee.washington.edu/index_files/Page701.htm), supervised by [Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang](http://www.ee.washington.edu/people/jenq-neng-hwang/).

I am a quick learner, problem solver and team worker who has a strong passion for systems and software development.
