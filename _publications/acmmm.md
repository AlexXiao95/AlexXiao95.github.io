This paper addresses an important yet less-studied problem: re-identifying groups of people in different camera views. Group re-identification (Re-ID) is very challenging since it is not only interfered by view-point and human pose variations in the traditional single-object Re-ID tasks, but also suffer from group layout and group member variations. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach, which leverages the multi-grain information inside groups to facilitate group Re-ID. We first introduce a multi-grain Re-ID process. It derives features from multi-grain objects (people/people-subgroups) in a group and iteratively evaluates their importance during group Re-ID, so as to handle the interferences from group dynamics. We further introduce a multi-order matching process. It integrates the multi-grain information from people/people-subgroups to obtain group-wise matching, and combines the information of both matched and unmatched objects to achieve a more reliable matching score. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
